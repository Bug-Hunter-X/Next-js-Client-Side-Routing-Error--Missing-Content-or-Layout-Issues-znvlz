# Next.js Client-Side Routing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using client-side routing in Next.js applications. The issue is characterized by missing content or layout inconsistencies on certain pages after navigation.

## Problem Description

The bug occurs when using Next.js's built-in client-side routing functionalities, primarily `next/link`,  to transition between pages.  In some cases, the target page's content might fail to render correctly, leaving parts of the page blank or displaying an unexpected layout.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate from the Home page to the About page using the provided link.
5. Observe the missing content on the About page. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper data fetching within the components, especially if relying on client-side data retrieval. This is crucial for situations where data is not readily available during initial page rendering.

## Additional Notes

This repository provides both a buggy and a corrected version to illustrate the problem and its solution.  Thorough data fetching is vital for successful client-side routing.
